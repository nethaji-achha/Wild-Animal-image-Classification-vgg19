# Wild life Animals Image Classification for Photographers using VGG19



In the process of learning the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence we have learned and tried many Algorithm and models for Image classifications.  As we know photographers has lot of collection of images of different so we have created an system based application so that if a photographer drops an images in our software the images will be classified into their specie and stored into separate folder so that photographer can find their desired specie image easily. In this project we have used VGG19 a 19 layer architecture CNN model, Python GUI, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas.
